# Dei Frati — Vite + React + TypeScript landing template

This is a local copy of a Vite + React + TypeScript landing page template for a restaurant.

## Quick start (local development)

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs with Vite (default port is 8080 per project config). Open http://localhost:8080 after starting the server.

## Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Project structure

- `src/` — React source code (components, pages, assets)
- `public/` — static assets served at `/`
- `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js` — build and styling configuration

## Technologies

- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-style UI primitives (in `src/components/ui`)

If you want me to remove any other external integrations or help prepare the repo for a specific hosting provider, tell me which one and I'll update the repo accordingly.
